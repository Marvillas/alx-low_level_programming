0x09. C - Static libraries
Static libraries are collections of object files that are linked directly into an executable program at compile-time, rather than being loaded at run-time like dynamic libraries. When you build a program that uses a static library, the object code from the library is copied into the executable file, making it self-contained and independent of external dependencies.

Static libraries are commonly used in software development to provide reusable code that can be shared across multiple programs. They can contain functions, classes, data structures, and other code that can be called by other programs to perform specific tasks.

Static libraries have some advantages over dynamic libraries, such as faster load times, simpler deployment, and better compatibility with older systems. However, they also have some drawbacks, such as increased executable size and the inability to update the library without recompiling the executable.
