In C programming, pointers and arrays are closely related concepts. Both pointers and arrays provide ways to access and manipulate memory addresses in a program.

Pointers
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers allow you to directly manipulate memory addresses and access the data stored at that location.

To declare a pointer variable, you use the * operator followed by the variable

int *ptr;

Arrays
An array is a collection of data elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow you to group related data together and access it using an index.

To declare an array in C, you specify the type of the elements in the array and the number of elements, like this:

int my_array[5];

This declares an integer array called my_array that can hold 5 elements.
